  A robust, open-source relational database known for performance, reliability, and advanced querying capabilities.

- **GraphQL**  
  Enables flexible and efficient data querying and mutation, allowing clients to request exactly the data they need.

- **Celery**  
  An asynchronous task queue used for handling background tasks such as sending emails and processing payments.

- **Redis**  
  A fast, in-memory data structure store used for caching, session management, and Celery task queuing.

- **Docker**  
  Ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments through containerization.

## 1. API Documentation
The backend APIs are well-documented using the **OpenAPI standard**, making them easy to understand and integrate. Both RESTful endpoints via **Django REST Framework** and flexible data querying via **GraphQL** are provided.

---

## 2. User Authentication
Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles through secure endpoints like `/users/` and `/users/{user_id}/`. This feature ensures identity verification, session management, and role-based access.

---

## 3. Property Management
Hosts can create, update, view, and delete their property listings via endpoints like `/properties/`. This functionality enables dynamic listing management, which is crucial for a scalable booking platform.

---

## 4. Booking System
Users can book properties by specifying check-in and check-out dates using endpoints like `/bookings/`. This system handles availability tracking, conflict prevention, and booking status updates.

---

## 5. Payment Processing
Integrated through endpoints like `/payments/`, this feature processes and records transactions securely. It ensures users can pay for bookings while maintaining traceable financial records.

---

## 6. Review System
After a stay, guests can leave feedback on properties via `/reviews/`. Ratings and comments help maintain quality and build trust among future users.

## 8. Notification System
Users receive real-time alerts for important actions like booking confirmations or cancellations. This enhances user engagement and keeps users informed without needing to refresh or log in constantly.

---

## 9. Image Upload & Management
Properties can have multiple images uploaded and managed, including selecting a cover image. Visual content is essential for user decision-making and improving booking conversion rates.

---

## 10. Analytics and Event Tracking
The system logs key events (e.g., property views, searches, logins) for usage analytics. This helps administrators understand user behavior and optimize the platform accordingly.
